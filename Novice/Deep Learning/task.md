# Deep Learning Tasks
## Task 1: Simple Neural Network
Build a basic neural network for binary classification.

## Requirements:
- Create synthetic data (two classes)
- Build a 2-layer neural network
- Train the model
- Visualize decision boundary
  
## Task 2: Multi-class Classification
Train a model to classify multiple categories.

Requirements:
- Load Iris or similar dataset
- Build a neural network
- Train and evaluate
- Show confusion matrix
  
## Task 3: Model Improvement
Compare different activation functions and optimizers.

Requirements:
- Use same dataset
- Try 2-3 different activation functions
- Try 2-3 different optimizers
- Compare results
